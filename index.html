    <h2>In a nutshell...</h2>
    <p> <font size="-3">Ahhhh jeez.</font> Hi! I'm Kamilah. I'm a junior studying journalism + design. I moved here from Southern California in 2015 (I spent my freshman year abroad in Ecuador). I played roller hockey for three years and spent more time in the penalty box than on the rink (I was 7 or 8 when I started). I grew up in the ocean and I miss it everyday and that's okay! I'm a first generation college student. My mom is from South Africa and my dad is from Thailand--visting pops' side this summer!

    <p>“The sun shines not on us but in us. The rivers flow not past, but through us. Thrilling, tingling, vibrating every fiber and cell of the substance of our bodies, making them glide and sing. The trees wave and the flowers bloom in our bodies as well as our souls, and every bird song, wind song, and tremendous storm song of the rocks in the heart of the mountains is our song, our very own, and sings our love.”</p>
<p>- John Muir, from his journals</p>
